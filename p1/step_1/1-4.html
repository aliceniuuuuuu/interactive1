    <strong>Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, l and it just gets worse as time goes by.</strong> 
    <br />The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and 
    <br />sleep, even if you can’t make it 300 years.

    <strong>Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it 
      <br />has nothing to do with the country of our residence.</strong> Ironically enough, states that cooperate with 
      <br />Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, where the state has 
      <br />a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies.
      <br />

    <strong>What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled.</strong> When Face-
    <br />book can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, and better than our spouses with 300 
    <br />likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for governments and for businesses. And predictability 
    <br />means control.

    <strong>Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends.</strong> Utility or 
    <br />qualityof things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool 
    <br />and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about 
    <br />Instagram, and no one knows what is next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize 
    <br />that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. 
    <br />Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly.
