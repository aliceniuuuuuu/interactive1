    is <strong>increasingly</strong> imposed on civilized lives, and it just <u>gets worse as time goes by.</u>
    <br />The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go 
    <br />into a cave and sleep, even if you can’t make it 300 years.

    Being watchedis something we all <strong>eventually</strong> have to get used to and live with and, 
    <br />sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states 
    <br />that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than 
    <br />like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal
    <br />those, access to social media companies.

    What is more <strong>frightening</strong> than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. 
    <br /><u><em>When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes</em></u>, and better 
    <br />than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for gover-
    <br />nments and for businesses. And predictability means control.

    Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are <strong>obsessed</strong> with new trends. 
    <br />Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s 
    <br />writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and 
    <br />then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is 
    <br />next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my 
    <br />concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. 
    <br />Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly.
