    <h1>MUSIC. MUSIC?</h1>
   <p>“The algorithms employed by major streaming services—particularly Spotify—are changing music. They’re making it less interesting, less diverse, and more corporate.” journalist Liz Pelly argued the December issue of The Baffler. 
   </p>
   <p>Spotify makes music so easy to be categorized in different mood themes that users stop criticizing it and are more likely to listen music as background noise. The music recommendation algorithm of major streaming services seem to be so convenient and correct that almost every user relies on them for listening to “new” music. However, do users really like the music, or are they convinced by the algorithms that they love the music recommended for them? 
   </p>
   <p>The recommendation algorithm subtracts the context and diversity of music. The algorithm is based on the history of a users listening. Does that mean the most frequently listened to music of a user is his or her the favorite music? Not necessarilly. The algorithm only filters music that matches the data that the algorithm has collected. An algorithm providing recommendations of music is not capable of identifying a users’ unique personality. 
  </p>
  <p>Maybe try to find new music without using algorithms starting today!
